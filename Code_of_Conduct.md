<h2>GenePattern Community Code of Conduct</h2>

The GenePattern community is made up of people from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences great successes and continued growth. When you're working with members of the community, we encourage you to follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and aim to keep the GenePattern community, positive, successful, and thriving.

<h2>Scope</h2>
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

A member of the GenePattern community is:
<h2>Open</h2>
Members of the community are open to collaboration. We're receptive to constructive comment and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.
<h2>Considerate</h2>
Members of the community are considerate of each other. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the work was done simply for the good of the community. We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
<h2>Respectful</h2>
Members of the community are respectful. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
Overall, we're good to each other. We are a part of this community because we want to be. If we remember that, these guidelines will come naturally.
