    "# GenePattern Python Library Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a short tutorial on how to use the [GenePattern Python library](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/programmers-guide#_Using_GenePattern_from_Python) in your Python scripts or in the [GenePattern Notebook](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/genepattern-notebooks) environment. In it we will develop a simple Python program that connects to a GenePattern Server, runs a module and loads the resulting files for further analysis. The included code can be executed directly from the notebook, so that you can try it out, modify it or create your own solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes that the reader is familiar with [GenePattern](http://genepattern.org) and its basic associated concepts, such as modules, jobs and result files. If you wish to learn more about GenePattern, [click here](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/).\n",
