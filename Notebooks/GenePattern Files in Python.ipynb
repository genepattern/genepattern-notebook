It demonstrates how to load data from GenePattern into these libraries, and how to send data from these libraries back to GenePattern.\n",

    "This tutorial assumes that the reader is familiar with [GenePattern](http://genepattern.org) and its basic associated concepts, such as modules, jobs and result files. A simple GenePattern tutorial is [available here](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/tutorial). It also assumes that the reader is familiar with the basics of the [GenePattern Python library](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/programmers-guide#_Using_GenePattern_from_Python). If you are not already familiar with this library, it is recommended that you first complete the [GenePattern Python Tutorial](http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/example-genepattern-notebooks).\n",
